            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi Everybody, it is so nice to meet you all my name is <strong>Jack Hogan</strong>.
                I am 31 years old, a typical mad Liverpool Football Club supporter sice birth and I am aspiring to become a Full Stack Engineeer. 
            </p>
            <p>  
                I grew up in Liverpool and never knew what I wanted to do with my life as I always thought I would go in the army like most of the men in my family.
            I served in the forces for just under 8 years and when I came out I tried to become a Personal Trainer, I tried to do Forklift Driving I even tried Cold 
            Calling but never really found any of it interesting. I finally found something that interested me in working for Openreach where I quickly progressed to 
            a Telecommunications Engineer. I spent years working for internet companies helping people doing this but it wasnt quite the final thing for me even though
             I knew I was close.    
            </p>
            <p>
                I started speaking to an old friend of mine who told me to look at becoming an full stack engineer telling me about the benefits and how much he has done<br>
                 well for himself doing it so far so I looked into it and realised this would be my next step up to what I was aiming for in my life.
                </p>
